# Click Rate Forecasting: Advanced Time Series Analysis with ARIMA, SARIMA, Moving Average & LSTM

This project demonstrates advanced forecasting techniques applied to time series data, specifically for click rate analysis. The repository includes implementations of several models:

- **ARIMA** (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)
- **Moving Average**
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)

By comparing these methods, the project showcases how both classical statistical techniques and modern deep learning approaches can be leveraged to predict future click rates.

## Project Overview

- **ARIMA & SARIMA Models:** Learn how to capture autoregressive and moving average components, including seasonal effects, to forecast time series.
- **Moving Average:** Utilize simple smoothing techniques to understand underlying trends and generate baseline forecasts.
- **LSTM Model:** Apply deep learning to accommodate non-linear patterns and potentially improve forecasting accuracy.

This project is an demonstration of time series analysis and forecasting.
